# KEYLOGGER

This keylogger project is built using Python and demonstrates how to capture and log every keystroke typed by a user. It records all inputs, storing them for later analysis. The tool is designed for educational and security research purposes, showcasing basic functionality in keylogging while emphasizing privacy and ethical concerns.

The keylogger works by running in the background of the system, monitoring the keyboard inputs without interrupting the user's activities. It captures keystrokes in real-time, logs them to a file, and can be programmed to store timestamps and other related metadata for later use. This allows for in-depth analysis of the captured data.

Although keyloggers are often associated with malicious activities, this project focuses on educating users about the technology and demonstrating the importance of securing personal data. It serves as a demonstration tool for understanding how easily sensitive information can be intercepted and the importance of using encryption and secure authentication methods.
